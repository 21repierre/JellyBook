# JellyBook

Hi, this is still in a very early, pre-alpha stage.
I have been working hard to try to get the app out by this weekend in a working state but I unfortinately was unable to do so.

I have decided to still release this early build in hope to recieve some attention and possible help.

## Currenty supported formats:
- `.cbz` files
- `.cbr` files (initial support)

## Todo

 - Where do i begin, lol
 - Add support for actual reading
 - pdf, epub, etc... support
 - Allow local caching of current files and still able to browse what books in collection when offline (proper offline support)
 - Remember user support
 - Multiple server support
 - Settings page
 - For the download completed screen I want to add a image or gif of a jellyfish reading a book (credit to thornbill on the Matrix server for that idea)
 - I want to improve the UI on the main menu screne and have a progress bar on already read books
 - Eat hot chip!
