# JellyBook

Hi, this is still in a very early, pre-alpha stage.
It has been maturing stedily since then but still not in a state im the happiest with.
As time goes on I will add more support and more features

## Now on TestFlight:
 - [https://testflight.apple.com/join/lEXKY4Dl](https://testflight.apple.com/join/lEXKY4Dl)

## Currenty supported formats:
- `.cbz` files
- `.cbr` files
- `.zip` files
- `.rar` files
- `.pdf` files
- `.epub` files (no image support yet)

## Todo

 - continuous vertical comics support, audiobooks, etc... support
 - Have a more universal experience between the rest of the formats and pdfs (pdf work a bit differently)
 - Allow local caching of current files and still able to browse what books in collection when offline (proper offline support)
 - Remember user support
 - Multiple server support
 - Settings page
 - For the download completed screen I want to add a image or gif of a jellyfish reading a book (credit to thornbill on the Matrix server for that idea)
 - UI Overhall in several areas of the app (will keep current for those who want it)
        - Part of the current issue is that it looks like a Android app made in Flutter which although it is made in Flutter, I want it to have a more cross platform feel to it
 - background download
 - Publish to several stores

## Known Issues
 - You cannot use a Self Signed SSL Cert with it. You may only use HTTP or a Trusted SSL Cert.
 - Due to the re-working of several components, you may need to reset the apps data after upgrading so that it still functions as intended
