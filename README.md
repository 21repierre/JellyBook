  Hi, this is a passion project I am working on.
  Its a app thats meant to allow you to read your files from Jellyfin on mobile.
  It is in a state where I do beleive it's useable for most comic reading and some books but it still has a long way to go.

## :construction: Todo:
 - [ ] Vertical scrolling
 - [ ] Audiobooks
 - [ ] Have a more universal experience between the rest of the formats and pdfs (pdf work a bit differently)
 - [ ] Allow local caching of current files and still able to browse what books in collection when offline (proper offline support)
 - [ ] Remember user support
 - [ ] Multiple server support
 - [ ] Settings page
 - [ ] For the download completed screen I want to add a image or gif of a jellyfish reading a book (credit to thornbill on the Matrix server for that idea)
 - [ ] UI Overhall in several areas of the app (will keep current as options for those who want it)
        - [ ] Part of the current issue is that it looks like a Android app made in Flutter which although it is made in Flutter, I want it to have a more cross platform feel to it
 - [ ] background download
 - [ ] Publish to several stores

## :warning: Known Issues
 - Due to the re-working of several components, you may need to reset the apps data after upgrading so that it still functions as intended
